# Hello World Kata

This seems trivial, but ask yourself:

"How would I TDD Hello World?"


## Problem Description

**Given**: [The three rules of TDD as Described by Uncle Bob](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd)
- You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
- You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
- You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.


Create a program, which outputs to the console, 'hello world'.
